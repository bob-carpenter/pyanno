From Andrey:

Annotators ids are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (ordered as shown in the paper),
1st, 2nd and so on columns of each matrix.  Matrix E has evidence codes for
each sentence fragment, F -- focus, P -- polarity.

[Rest of the columns are for the 5 follow-up annotators.]

From Bob:

Read distribution binary "8-5.mat" into MATLAB and
used csvwrite() on the resulting matrices E85, F85,
and P85.
