pyAnno 1.0 INSTALLATION
============================================================

pyAnno can be installed on any platform that runs Python, including
all recent flavors of Windows, Mac, and Linux.  Here's what you
need to do:

0. Install Dependencies:

   - Python 2.6
     http://www.python.org/

   - numpy 1.4
     http://numpy.scipy.org/

   - pymc 2.1
     http://code.google.com/p/pymc/

   The Enthought Python distribution includes Python 2.6 and numpy 1.4
   and makes installing pymc easy.  It is free for academics and
   available for a fee for others from:

   http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php

   I couldn't get the 64-bit Python to work with numpy and pymc, but
   your mileage may vary.


1. Create Directory $PYANNO_DIR for pyanno


2. Download pyanno-1.0.zip into $PYANNO_DIR


3. Unpack pyanno-1.0.zip into $PYANNO_DIR

   You can do this from the Explorer in Windows by:
       a. navigating to $PYANNO_DIR, 
       b. right clicking on pyanno-1.0.zip,
       c. selecting [extract all]
       d. entering $PYANNO_DIR path or browsing for it
       e. click [Extract] button

   Or from a shell with:
       % cp pyanno-1.0.zip $PYANNO_DIR
       % cd $PYANNO_DIR
       % unzip pyanno-1.0.zip

   We like the Cygwin distribution to get tools like
   unzip in Windows: http://www.cygwin.com/


4. Install pyanno into Python:
   This you'll need to do from a shell:

       % cd pyanno-1.0
       % python setup.py install
